# Trekk: Project Overview

## Concept

This project aims to create an AI-driven life simulation game where players can live out a virtual life through natural language inputs. The game is designed to be open-ended, allowing players to make a wide variety of life choices and experience the consequences of their decisions.

## Current State

As of now, the project is in its early stages of development. We have implemented a basic framework that includes:

1. A simple life simulation system tracking various attributes (location, age, job, money, etc.)
2. A location system with random generation of cities and their descriptions
3. Basic natural language processing to interpret player commands
4. Simple systems for job applications, working, learning skills, and building relationships
5. A status checking feature to view current life statistics

## Planned Features

While the current implementation provides a foundation, we have ambitious plans for expanding the game's capabilities:

1. Enhanced NLP: Improve the game's ability to understand and respond to a wider range of player inputs.
2. Dynamic Event Generation: Create a system for generating random events based on the player's current status and past actions.
3. Procedural Content Generation: Dynamically create locations, characters, and storylines for a more diverse and unpredictable world.
4. Complex Action-Consequence System: Implement more nuanced and far-reaching consequences for player actions.
5. Time and Aging System: Add a time progression system that affects the character's life opportunities and challenges.
6. Expanded Relationship System: Create more complex NPC interactions with unique personalities and storylines.
7. Detailed Career and Skill Progression: Implement more comprehensive systems for job advancement and skill development.
8. Economic System: Develop a more realistic economic model affecting various aspects of the game world.
9. Health and Lifestyle System: Create a detailed health system influenced by the character's choices and random events.
10. Memory and Learning: Implement a system for the game to remember and learn from past interactions for more consistent and logical responses.

## Technical Challenges

The main technical challenges we're tackling include:

1. Natural Language Processing: Accurately interpreting a wide range of player inputs.
2. AI-Driven Narrative: Creating coherent and interesting storylines based on player actions.
3. Balancing Randomness and Coherence: Ensuring the game world feels both unpredictable and logical.
4. Performance Optimization: Managing complex systems efficiently for smooth gameplay.

## Future Direction

Our goal is to create a highly replayable, AI-driven life simulation that offers unique experiences with each playthrough. We're exploring the use of machine learning models to enhance the game's ability to understand player intent and generate engaging content.

As we continue to develop this project, we welcome feedback and ideas from the community. While we're not currently accepting direct contributions, we encourage interested developers to fork the project and experiment with their own implementations of these concepts.
